xbeboot - *the original Xbox Linux bootloader*
==============================================
xbeboot is a Linux bootloader for the original Xbox. xbeboot was originally developed by the [Xbox Linux Project](https://web.archive.org/web/20100617000252/http://www.xbox-linux.org/wiki/Main_Page).

xbeboot is noteworthy for not only allowing booting from DVD/CD and Hard Drive, but also allowing bundling a kernel into the .xbe itself
